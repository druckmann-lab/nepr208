If you get stuck on [part 1](static_files/problem_sets/ProblemSetPerceptrons.pdf), you can download some sample perceptron code [here](static_files/code/BinaryPerceptronSampleCode.m)

[Part two of the problem set](static_files/problem_sets/ps1_part2_extra_credit.pdf) is extra credit and explores neural nonlinearities that result in oscillations. These features would not be revealed with simple integrate and fire (IF) networks.

To explore the roles of ion channels in governing neural behavior, the tutorial and software, Electrophysiology of the Neuron (EOTN), is available. The software can be found here: [EOTN](https://huguenardlab.stanford.edu/eotn/)

We need each of you to install the program (you will get two programs installed, SimVC and SimCC, for voltage clamp and current clamp simulations, respectively).

Here is the [original book](https://hlab.stanford.edu/eotn/ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY%20OF%20THE%20NEURON.pdf) (the book is out of print, but there is a pdf) that David McCormick (Yale University) and John Huguenard wrote to develop some simple exercises for teaching in a dry lab the basics of resting membrane potentials, stimulation, synapses, action potentials, synaptic currents, etc.

You can download the .cc5 files you need for part 2, which is for extra credit, [here](static_files/code/ps1_pt2_exp1.cc5)
And here is a link to the archived parameter files to be used for the exercises in the book: [eotn_parameters_v4.tgz](/static_files/code/eotn_parameters_v4.tgz)

If you are interested, you can see a historical web page describing the book [here](http://eotn.stanford.edu)
