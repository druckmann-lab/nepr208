Everyone will need this data file: [rgc_data.h5](../static_files/code/rgc_data.h5)
- If you'd like to use python and don't have it installed locally on your machines, use this [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jz5quQULrj1PHYg5vyxIDooRae7a20VG?usp=sharing)
- If you'd like to use python local to your machine, download this starter code: [python notebook](../static_files/code/NEPR208_PS2_Starter_Code.ipynb)
- If you'd like to use matlab, download this starter code: [matlab files](../static_files/code/ps2_matlab.zip)

Very stuck? Take a peek at some possible answers [here](../static_files/code/NEPR208_PS2_Code_To_Get_Unstuck.ipynb). But if you use this code in your submission, comment the code you submit with a brief explanation of what is happening in each line/chunk of code.
