This is the Programming Basics assignment. The goal is to get you started with coding in Python if you haven't had much experience before. We will be going over these exercises in the optional lecture in Week 2. If you are experienced with coding, please complete the 4 exercises within the Colab notebook.

To work on the assignment, please copy the linked notebook into your own Google Drive. 

To submit the assignment, please download the .ipynb file and submit it on Canvas before the deadline.
