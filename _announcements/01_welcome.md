Welcome everyone!


We’re looking forward to meeting you all for our first class tomorrow (Thursday, 1/6) at 5pm! The first class will be on Zoom (link on Canvas).

We’ll start with a brief discussion of course logistics, and then jump straight into learning the maths and the tools! :)


Please register to our [Piazza](https://piazza.com/stanford/winter2022/nepr209) for all course discussions and announcements.


Minseung and John
