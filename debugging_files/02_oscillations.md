title: Oscillations
description: "This lecture will cover 3 related topics: 
- Network oscillations via coupled inhibitory cells (Wang and Buzsaki, 1996, ref 1)
- Oscillations between up and down states (Wilson, 2005, ref 2) in striatum, and their dependence on KIR channels
- Thalamic relay neurons as intrinsic oscillators dependent on interactions between H current and T current, and how synaptic inhibitory responses engage this intrinsic oscillatory activity (McCormick and Pape, 1990, ref 3)"
