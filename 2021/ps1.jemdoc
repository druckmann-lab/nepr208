= Problem set 1: Single neuron mechanisms and oscillations

== Exercises
- Part 1: *[pdf/ps1_part1.pdf PDF for Part 1]*
- Part 2: *[pdf/ps1_part2.pdf PDF for Part 2]*

== Code / other files
- If you get stuck on part 1, you can download some sample perceptron code here: *[code/BinaryPerceptronSampleCode.m perceptron]*
- You can download the .cc5 files you need for Part 2 here: *[code/ps1_pt2_exp1.cc5 cc5]*
- If you want to explore parameters, you can download additional parameter sets provided by John Huguenard: *[code/eotn_parameters_v4.tgz parameters]*
- If you want to load your EOTN data into matlab for further analysis, you can export to .txt from EOTN, and then use *[code/read_EOTN_file.m this]* matlab script to load the data in. If you prefer to use python *[code/convert.py here]*'s a python script that converts the text file to .mat or .npy formats. 

== Submission
You will work in groups, but please write up your own solutions. Include any plots you generate, as well as answers to any questions. Figures should have labels, units, and clear descriptions of what the figure is showing. The write up is due in next Monday, 4/27.
